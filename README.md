# Doe

##### Doe is a highly precise device and screen orientation emulator for developing and debugging sensor-related web apps on desktop computers

It can be used to build and debug device orientation and screen orientation aware applications without needing to test on mobile devices.

#### Usage

Just add the [Device Orientation Emulator script](https://github.com/richtr/doe/blob/gh-pages/doe.js) to any web page on which you want to enable the doe emulator:

```html
<script src="https://richtr.github.io/doe/doe.js"></script>
```

Now open your web page and follow the prompt to open it in the doe emulator.

#### Examples

In any web browser that does not support device orientation (e.g. Desktop browsers) you can open one of the following pages:
