### Device Orientation Emulator

A simple and precise device orientation emulator for use in Desktop-based web browsers.

#### Usage

- Add the injection script to the web page you want to test:

``` html
<script src="https://richtr.github.io/deviceorientationemulator/DeviceOrientationEmulator.js"></script>
```

- Load this page in a web browser and ensure popups are enabled for that web page!

3. When the popup successfully loads, drag the virtual device around the screen to propagate 'deviceorientation' events towards the opener window.
