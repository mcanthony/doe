# Device Orientation Emulator
A simple and precise device orientation emulator for use in Desktop-based web browsers.

## Demo
On any desktop-based web browser open the following page:

[https://richtr.github.io/Marine-Compass/](https://richtr.github.io/Marine-Compass/)

If your browser does not support Device Orientation Events then you will be asked if you want to use the emulator.

That's it!

## Usage
Step 1. Add the Device Orientation Emulator script to any web page you want to allow the emulator to run on when device orientation event support can not be detected:

```html
<script src="https://richtr.github.io/deviceorientationemulator/DeviceOrientationEmulator.js"></script>
```

Step 2. There is no step 2.

Happy debugging of device orientation events :)
